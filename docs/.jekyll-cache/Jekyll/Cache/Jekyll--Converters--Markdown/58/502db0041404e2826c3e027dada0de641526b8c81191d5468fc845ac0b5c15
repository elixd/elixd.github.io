I"x<p>I have just spoken to our IT contractor, who set up his own WordPress blog some time ago. His blog got hached in 4 month. I decided that I will do some security tweaks on my blog to prevent loosing access and data.</p>

<p>I will not describe what to do, as I found <a href="https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/secure-your-wordpress-website/">a good how too on the topic</a></p>
