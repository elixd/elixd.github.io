I have just spoken to our IT contractor, who set up his own WordPress blog some time ago. His blog got hached in 4 month. I decided that I will do some security tweaks on my blog to prevent loosing access and data.

I will not describe what to do, as I found [a good how too on the topic](https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/secure-your-wordpress-website/)
