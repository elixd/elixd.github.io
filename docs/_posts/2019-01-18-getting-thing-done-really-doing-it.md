I have come across multinple approaches and systems to help you get through the work efficinetly and reach your goals.

And the main conclusion: any system is better when exececude well, than looking for a better system.

GTD, Kanban, Agile etc... Try any of those, but you need to pick one and implement it 100% to become efficint before trying something else

LeanKit tool [website](https://leankit.com/learn/kanban/kanban-board-examples-for-development-and-operations/), looks promising
